# Coffee Production and Quality Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to perform an in-depth exploration, cleaning, and analysis of the **Coffee Quality Database** to extract valuable insights related to coffee production and quality.

## Objectives
- **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values and inconsistencies to ensure data reliability.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conduct univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis to uncover trends and relationships.
- **Visualization:** Create insightful visual representations to illustrate distributions, correlations, and patterns in the dataset.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handling missing and duplicate values.
   - Standardizing formats and fixing inconsistencies.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - **Univariate Analysis:** Understanding individual variables.
   - **Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis:** Identifying relationships between features.
   - **Statistical Insights:** Examining key factors affecting coffee quality.

3. **Visualizations:**
   - Distribution of coffee species and processing methods.
   - Relationship between cup scores and various attributes.
   - Geographic trends in coffee production.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## Key Insights
- **Arabica is the most preferred coffee species.**
- **The washed (wet) processing method is widely used for quality enhancement.**
- **Lower moisture content leads to better storage and quality retention.**
- **Cup scores of 80+ define specialty-grade coffee, with potential for premium markets.**

## Conclusion
By applying robust data cleaning and analysis techniques, this project provides meaningful insights into coffee production and quality. The findings can help industry stakeholders improve coffee cultivation, processing, and marketability.
